Whats Up!

I make food and stuff all the time and love to eat pie. I'm also a swiffer sweeper on the weekends.
Maybe one day i'll be good enough to buy my own gas station. One day, I will.

My hair turned blue one day. I still have no idea why this happened. My ultimate goal in life is to figure out why this happened, and then make a super awesome book report on the subject. I wont stop until I find an answer.
